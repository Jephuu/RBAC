## Features

- **User Authentication**: 
  - Register and login functionality with hashed passwords.
- **Protected Routes**: 
  - Only authenticated users can access specific routes.
- **Role-Based Access Control**:
  - Users have roles like Admin, Moderator, or User.
  - Access is controlled based on roles.
- **Role Management**: 
  - Admin can update user roles.

## Technologies Used

- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB (Mongoose)
- JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication
- bcrypt for password hashing
- dotenv for environment variable management

API Endpoints
   Authentication
  1. Register

          "password": "password123"
       }

Testing with Thunder Client

  1. Register a User:
      Send a POST request to /api/users/register.

  2. Login:
      Send a POST request to /api/users/login and retrieve the token.

  3. Access Protected Routes:
      Use the token in the Authorization header as Bearer <token> to access protected routes.

  4.  Update Role:
      Use the PUT /api/users/update-role/:id endpoint with the user ID and the new role.             Include the admin token in the Authorization header.
